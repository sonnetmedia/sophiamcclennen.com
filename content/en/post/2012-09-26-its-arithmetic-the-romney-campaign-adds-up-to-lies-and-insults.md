We need to continue to thank Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert for using their powerful political comedy to shed some light on these recent developments. The segments they have run show us that Romney&#8217;s comments are not gaffes. They are not bloopers. In fact, they are glimpses into the character behind the candidates.

Colbert hit this point home with typical satirical wit when his right-wing pundit character <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/419186/september-18-2012/mitt-romney-s-secret-video" target="_hplink">explained</a> that this was &#8220;not a crisis for Romney, this is a triumph, because Mitt nailed it! Obama supporters are nothing but lazy parasites.&#8221; He then came to Mitt&#8217;s rescue by showing him how to &#8220;elegantly deliver his message with more panache.&#8221; Watch the clip here:

As the mainstream news media stumbles from one campaign crisis to another, we can thank *Comedy Central *for offering us two credible sources on the key issues behind the campaign. Stewart and Colbert combine night after night to offer us a refreshing critique of the media coverage of the campaigns and of the spin offered by the candidates. And they do it while entertaining us.

To trope on Bill Clinton, &#8220;It&#8217;s Arithmetic.&#8221; Colbert and Stewart have shown us that the Romney campaign adds up to lies and insults. Now it&#8217;s our turn to do the math and decide what this campaign really adds up to.
