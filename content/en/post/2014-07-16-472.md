#### Is Satire Saving our Nation?



My new book&#8211;co-written with Remy Maisel &#8211;will be out on October 30. Is satire saving our nation? Does our democracy depend on it? Or is satire destroying our faith in the political process? Pre-order to make sure you have a copy in time for the mid-term elections!
