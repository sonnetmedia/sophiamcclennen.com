The idea that a satire news show would take election coverage so seriously no longer comes as a surprise.</description></item><item><title>Prof. McClennen delivers lecture on why Human Rights depend on the humanities at ASU's Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict.</title><link>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/prof.-mcclennen-delivers-lecture-on-why-human-rights-depend-on-the-humanities-at-asus-center-for-the-study-of-religion-and-conflict./</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/prof.-mcclennen-delivers-lecture-on-why-human-rights-depend-on-the-humanities-at-asus-center-for-the-study-of-religion-and-conflict./</guid><description>Human rights concerns continue to occupy a central role in contemporary politics and NGOs. They also appear frequently in the teaching and research of university faculty. But do policy makers and professors speak the same language when they discuss human rights? This talk looks at the assumed breakdown in the discourses of human rights practitioners and humanities theorists, and shows that the insights of human rights theory indeed play a major role in human rights policy.</description></item><item><title>Stewart, Colbert and Oliver for the win: Satire, millennials and fear of an extreme right-wing Senate</title><link>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/stewart-colbert-and-oliver-for-the-win-satire-millennials-and-fear-of-an-extreme-right-wing-senate/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/stewart-colbert-and-oliver-for-the-win-satire-millennials-and-fear-of-an-extreme-right-wing-senate/</guid><description>This week “The Daily Show” ramped up their media coverage of midterm elections by heading to Texas for a week of shows entitled Democalypse 2014: South by South Mess. The guest the first night? Wendy Davis, of course. But before we get too excited at the idea that a satire news show is going to the center of a hotly disputed governor’s race, it’s worth remembering that four years ago today, on October 30, 2010, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert rallied on the National Mall in an unprecedented media stunt that put satire at the center of political debate.</description></item><item><title>First time in Penn State history: professor and undergrad team up to write book</title><link>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/first-time-in-penn-state-history-professor-and-undergrad-team-up-to-write-book/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/first-time-in-penn-state-history-professor-and-undergrad-team-up-to-write-book/</guid><description>University Park, PA — What if the next presidential election is decided by viewers of &amp;ldquo;The Daily Show,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Colbert Report&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,&amp;rdquo; rather than viewers of CNN, Fox News and MSNBC? Are satirists giving a more objective and factual view of the news?
In her new book, Penn State School of International Affairs professor Sophia McClennen argues that as millennials enter the voting pool, they predominantly watch their news in the form of satire, instead of cable news, and this is changing politics.</description></item><item><title>Research center led by SIA professor obtains grants of over $2 million supporting global studies at Penn State, K-12, and in the community</title><link>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/research-center-led-by-sia-professor-obtains-grants-of-over-2-million-supporting-global-studies-at-penn-state-k-12-and-in-the-community/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/research-center-led-by-sia-professor-obtains-grants-of-over-2-million-supporting-global-studies-at-penn-state-k-12-and-in-the-community/</guid><description>UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — The Center for Global Studies (CGS) at Penn State, led by School of International Affairs professor Sophia McClennen, announced the award of two new federal grants that will help continue bringing together faculty and students from across the University in order to realize Penn State’s strategic goal of becoming a global university.

We have seen multiple stories emphasize the encounter as a “face off” that got so intense that at times the two shouted at each other. But here’s another way of looking at it: Bill O’Reilly just can’t resist Jon Stewart’s logic.</description></item><item><title>Daily Collegian covers *Is Satire Saving Our Nation?*</title><link>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/daily-collegian-covers-is-satire-saving-our-nation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/daily-collegian-covers-is-satire-saving-our-nation/</guid><description>Read about how my latest book is making Penn State history as the university&amp;rsquo;s first ever undergrad-prof writing team.

We know that Jon Stewart has been voted as the No. 4 most trusted journalist, tying with Brian Williams and Dan Rather (that poll was in 2008). We know that satirists like Stewart have an active and engaged viewership of mostly millennials. And we know that over the years Stewart has been able to attract an impressive lineup of politicians, journalists and other newsmakers to appear on his interview segment.</description></item><item><title>John Oliver is smarter than the State Department: Irony will not defeat ISIS</title><link>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/john-oliver-is-smarter-than-the-state-department-irony-will-not-defeat-isis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/john-oliver-is-smarter-than-the-state-department-irony-will-not-defeat-isis/</guid><description>While we fight a war against ISIS with airstrikes on selected targets, the U.S. is also engaging in a war of ideas. As many who have seen ISIS videos or seen pro-ISIS tweets can attest, the Islamic State group has demonstrated a skill with social media previously unseen in extremist groups. ISIS has successfully used Internet sites, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to dangerous effect, often with the explicit goal of recruiting more militants.</description></item><item><title>Stewart, Colbert save the day: Bill O’Reilly and Fox News’ ISIS insanity makes them more essential than ever</title><link>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/stewart-colbert-save-the-day-bill-oreilly-and-fox-news-isis-insanity-makes-them-more-essential-than-ever/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/stewart-colbert-save-the-day-bill-oreilly-and-fox-news-isis-insanity-makes-them-more-essential-than-ever/</guid><description>As the nation continues airstrikes on ISIS in Syria and Iraq, the U.S. public is bracing for yet another military conflict in the Middle East. And in order to make sense of this new crisis viewers are finding that “fake news” often offers better analysis than the so-called “real news.” While Fox News’s Eric Bolling called the first female UAE pilot that bombed the Islamic State “boobs on the ground” and coverage on all major news channels mistakenly described ISIS as an imminent threat to the United States, fake news offered the U.</description></item><item><title>Book Trailer for *Is Satire Saving our Nation*</title><link>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/book-trailer-for-is-satire-saving-our-nation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/10/book-trailer-for-is-satire-saving-our-nation/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Is neoliberalism ruining our universities?</title><link>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/09/is-neoliberalism-ruining-our-universities/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sophiamcclennen.com/blog/2014/09/is-neoliberalism-ruining-our-universities/</guid><description>Truthout has published an excerpt from my co-authored book with Jeffrey Di Leo, Sophia McClennen, and Kenneth Saltman: Neoliberalism, Education, Terrorism: Contemporary Dialogues.

Speaking in character as a bloviating right-wing pundit, Colbert explained that truthiness was thinking from the gut, ignoring facts, and holding beliefs with no basis in reality.

Stephen Colbert has called us losers. He got us (and 999 other fan groups based at universities) to buy his Super Fun Pack, filled it with what seemed like a series of gag items, and then asked us all to solve an extremely complex treasure hunt.
